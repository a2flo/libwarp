*libwarp*

Image-space Warping library, implementing scatter-based warping, bidirectional gather-based warping and forward-only gather-based warping.

*Build Instructions:*
* build and install libfloor: https://github.com/a2flo/floor
* Unix: ./build.sh
* OS X: open libwarp.xcodeproj in Xcode and build
* Windows: open libwarp.sln in Visual Studio and build

*Installation (Linux, OS X, other Unix):*
* mkdir -p /opt/libwarp
* sudo ln -sf /path/to/libwarp/include /opt/libwarp/include
* sudo ln -sf /path/to/libwarp/bin /opt/libwarp/lib
* alternatively: copy these files/folders there

*Installation (Windows / VS / MinGW/MSYS2):*
* create a "%%ProgramFiles%%/libwarp" folder (C:/Program Files/libwarp)
* inside this folder:
** copy the libwarp "include" folder there
** create a "lib" folder and copy libwarp.lib/libwarpd.lib there

*example:*
* warp example in https://github.com/a2flo/floor_examples

*snippets:*
* GLSL, Metal and libfloor compute/graphics C++ snippets to render the required scatter/gather images can be found in the "etc/" folder
